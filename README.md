# Final-Projectt
First, here's the link to my video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IODmUqxD7jo


Some extra things about my project:

My biggest challenge was figuring out how to make the player's choices matter.  I didn't want my game to feel super linear. To work around this, I made the heart points variable as explained in my video.  While in this game I only had 2 endings per character, I could have made even more endings by implementing that variable.  That was my original plan but I decided to cut it down so I could finish properly.

The thing i enjoyed the most was honestly the UI design. I spent the most time adjusting font sizes and colors, outlines, text box placement, and other things trying to customize as much of it as I could.  I wanted my project to feel unique to me and my style, and I think I accomplished that well.

All in all, I enjoyed this project a ton and see myself coming back to Ren'py in the future to make a longer VN when I have a good story to tell!
