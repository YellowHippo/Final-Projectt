# Final-Projectt
First, here's the link to my video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IODmUqxD7jo


Some extra things about my project:

I learned a lot about visual novel making! There's a lot of things that go into making a good VN, and I would have loved to include more sprites, sound effects, and scenes

I learned a lot of the code from the Ren'Py tutorial, and I played a bunch of free VN's online to gain some inspiration for things like colors, music, and font choice

All in all, I enjoyed this project a ton and see myself coming back to Ren'py in the future to make a longer VN when I have a good story to tell!
